# MultiVec
C++ implementation of *word2vec*, *bivec*, and *paragraph vector*.

## Features

### Monolingual model
* Most of word2vec's features [1, 6]
* Evaluation on the *analogical reasoning task* (multithreaded version of word2vec's *compute-accuracy*)
* Batch and online paragraph vector [2]
* Save & load full model, including configuration and vocabulary
* Python wrapper

### Bilingual model
* Bivec-like training with a parallel corpus [3, 7]
* Save & load full model
* Trains two monolingual models, which can be exported and used by MultiVec
* Python wrapper

## Dependencies
* GCC 4.4+
* CMake 2.6+
* Cython

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/eske/multivec.git
    mkdir multivec/build
    cd multivec/build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd ..

The `bin` directory should now contain 4 binaries:
* `multivec-mono` which is used to generate monolingual models;
* `multivec-bi` to generate bilingual models;
* `word2vec` which is a modified version of word2vec that matches our user interface;
* `compute-accuracy` to evaluate word embeddings on the analogical reasoning task (multithreaded version of word2vec's compute-accuracy program).

## Usage examples
First create two directories `data` and `models` at the root of the project, where you will put the text corpora and trained models.
The script `scripts/prepare-data.py` can be used to pre-process a corpus (punctuation normalization, tokenization, etc.)

    mkdir data
    mkdir models
    wget http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/training-parallel-nc-v9.tgz -P data
    tar xzf data/training-parallel-nc-v9.tgz -C data
    scripts/prepare-data.py data/training/news-commentary-v9.fr-en data/news-commentary fr en --tokenize --normalize-punk

To train a monolingual model using text corpus `data/news-commentary.en`:

    bin/multivec-mono --train data/news-commentary.en --save models/news-commentary.en.bin --threads 16

To train a bilingual model using parallel corpus `data/news-commentary.fr` and `data/news-commentary.en`:

    bin/multivec-bi --train-src data/news-commentary.fr --train-trg data/news-commentary.en --save models/news-commentary.fr-en.bin --threads 16

To load a bilingual model and export it to source and target monolingual models:

    bin/multivec-bi --load models/news-commentary.fr-en.bin --save-src models/news-commentary.fr.bin --save-trg models/news-commentary.en.bin

To evaluate a trained English model on the analogical reasoning task, first export the model to the word2vec format, then use `compute-accuracy`:

    bin/multivec-mono --load models/news-commentary.en.bin --save-vectors models/vectors.txt
    bin/compute-accuracy models/vectors.txt 0 < word2vec/questions-words.txt

### Python wrapper

    cd cython
    make

Use from Python (`multivec.so` must be in the `PYTHONPATH`, e.g. working directory):

    python2
    >>> from multivec import MonolingualModel, BilingualModel
    >>> model = BilingualModel('models/news-commentary.fr-en.bin')
    >>> model.trg_model
    <multivec.MonolingualModel at 0x7fcfe0d59870>
    >>> model.trg_model.word_vec('France')
    array([ 0.2600708 ,  0.72489363, ...,  1.00654161,  0.38837495])
    >>> new_model = BilingualModel(dimension=300, threads=16)
    >>> new_model.train('data/news-commentary.fr', 'data/news-commentary.en')
    >>> help(BilingualModel)  # all the help you need

## TODO
* paragraph vector: DBOW model (similar to skip-gram)
* paragraph vector: option to concatenate, sum or average with word vectors on projection layer.
* GIZA alignment for bilingual model
* bilingual paragraph vector training
